# Rubicon-Enhanced Retbleed

This repository contains the implementation of the Rubicon-enhanced Retbleed attack. This attack exploits the Retbleed vulnerability in Intel and AMD processors, leveraging the Rubicon framework to precisely position `/etc/shadow` at a known physical memory location. By doing so, it eliminates the need for the lengthy scanning phase present in the original Retbleed attack, enabling direct access to sensitive data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`massage/`**: Contains the implementation of the Rubicon framework, which is responsible for positioning `/etc/shadow` at a known physical memory location.
- **`intel/`**: Includes the code for the Rubicon-enhanced Retbleed attack targeting Intel processors.
- **`zen/`**: Includes the code for the Rubicon-enhanced Retbleed attack targeting AMD processors.
- **`kmod_read_mem/`**: Contains the kernel module and user-space program used to read the physical address of `/etc/shadow` for validating experimental results.
